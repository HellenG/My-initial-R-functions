# My-initial-R-functions
Custom functions that can be applied for data analysis. 
 Currently (26th-July-2015) there are three R functions
 
The first two functions are part on my on going EDA class notes development process. They are the proportion and percentages function.

The third function will form part of the probability functions aimed towards understanding the probability concepts. The approach used is one of "learning-while-having-fun" as it is more of a game.


P.S. Ideas, bug fixes e.t.c are all welcomed.
